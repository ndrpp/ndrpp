### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer currently working professionally with everyone's favorite language: JavaScript.

I'm also <s>learning for my first cloud certificate</s> (got [it](https://www.credly.com/badges/d0a93d6a-5191-4597-889e-29e4a3586b6e/public_url)!!) and in my free time I'm focusing on improving my minimal linux workflow and playing a bit with Golang.
